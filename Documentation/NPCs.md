# NPCs
The NPCs will be described acccording to the two parts of the Mod. The first section will discuss the Crew of the [Shipname], and the second one the Mage and Guards involved in the expedition and restoration of the Iskulgard Castle.

Each section has one major NPC for dialogue and main quest involvement. These are the Captain of [Shipname] that is involved in the aquisition quest as well as the restoration and expedition. The Mage will join for the expedition and then is the main Character in the restoration Questline.

Minor NPCs will only have minor quests for their hiring or upgrading. Like finding a rare Axe for Torvald or telling him the story how you went drinking with sanguine. The goal of the minor NPCs is to create the Athmosphere instead of being main protagonists. Still each one should have a personality, backstory and character progression.


All NPCs should have:
* Name, personality 
* Hobby represented in their private space (Drawing, reading, smithing, gardening etc.)


## SHIP Questline

### Captain Tulia - Major
#### Bio:
She is an imperial in her mid 30s who grew up in Anvil and started her career in the imperial Navy, quickly rising through the ranks gaining her first command. During the War with the Thalmor her ship was assigned to an attack group. Due to the casualties among the experienced high ranking officers a high ranking commander of the East Empire Company was reassigned to lead the fleet. This proved disastrous since his experience of traveling on trade routes did not prepare him for war and his Ego stopped him from following advice. One time when they were anchoring they were ambushed by Thalmor. Due to his orders to anchor in a formation designed to defend trade fleets from pirates they were unable to quickly respond to the attack. Tulia and a couple others survived and managed to swim to a small Island off the Hammerfell coast. Since that day she detests Thalmor on a personal level. 
The survivors repaired the least damaged ship to be mostly seaworthy and set sails for the coast. After returning to the next Port in Hammerfell she learns that her part of the fleet was thought lost and was disbanded. Seeing the White gold concordat as a betrayal she decided to become an independent trader/smuggler instead of rejoining the navy. Four of the survivors joined her. At the beginning it was more a group by convenience but they grew to become friends over the months sailing together.

She plays loose with rules but has enough charm and brains to get away with it most of the time. Always joking and witty on the outside but calculating and very protective of her crew and ship. Clear principles against slave and addictive drug trade.
