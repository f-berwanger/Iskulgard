# NPCs
NPCs can be split in two main groups. There will only be a handful of major NPCs which are highly involved with questlines as well as having a sort of character progression.

Minor NPCs will not be involved in any Quests and are mainly for Athmosphere.

All NPCs should have:
* Name, personality 
* Hobby represented in their private space (Drawing, reading, smithing, gardening etc.)


## Major NPCs

### Captain
* Female Redguard
* Charming Swashbuckler type (Maybe Jack Sparrow inspired)
* On the bad side of Gang/Officials/Faction, lying low in skyrim
* annoyed by doing nothing, excited about expedition
* change in character during questline, from greedy pirate to loyal captain
* Main quest NPC for Expedition storyline, from upgrading and supplying ship
* After finished Expedition upgrades to unlock further fast travel points

### Mage
* Very old male altmer
* Traveled all over Tamriel during his life
* Powerful mage, knolagable about Dwemer technology and interesting in nordic tomb building techniques.
* Convinced of altmer supperiority, so a bit arrogant (or parenting if altmer player). Charming but slightly racist Granddad
* Ideological difference with Thalmor so exiled from Altmeris and homesick.
* Convinced the "lesser races" have some good innovations from time to time and wants the altmer to learn and improve them.
* Strongly opposed to oppressing and enslaving other races. wants the Altmer to lead by example, to inspire and guide the development.
* Involved since Expedition, main Contact for castle rebuilding

## Minor NPCs

### Sailors
