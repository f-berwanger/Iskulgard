# Lore
THe Lore can be split into three sections, describing its history from first discovery to the state where the player finds it.

## Legend of Ysgramors Crossing
Original:
The Legend tells how he lost his son Yngol to the Sea Ghosts. Later he braves the Storms in his Search and after finding his sons dead body he kills many beasts in his honor. 

My Spin:
During the Crossing Yngols longship gets seperated in a storm and then found by a clan of Sea Giants, who kill or capture the exhausted crew. 
They take them to the Island, where they established a small village and procede start eating their victims. Ysgramor finds the Island during his search, where the Giants were just finished slaughtering Yngol for their next meal. 
Ysgramor and his crew slaughter them all but only 2 survivors remain from Yngols original crew to tell the tale. After burying his son Ysgramor swore he would do everything in his power to ensure no father would ever lose his son in this way during the crossing. 
For this purpose he established a small military outpost on the Island with the goal to protect shiping between Skyrim and atmora and slay every Sea Giants they come across. 

## Golden Age & Downfall
After Ysgramors return many Atmorans settled in Skyrim and a flourishing Trade developed between both continents. Back then the Ghost Sea was already very harsh to cross, so the Island represented an essential safe Haven at about the Half way point. Due to this importance it quickly rose to prominance. The small military outpost grew into a sizable fortress ontop of the center Spire and several additional Dock areas were created where Ships could anchor and stay for a night before continuing their Journey. Due to its steap cliffs there never was the space to establish a small city or sprawling storage complexes. Because of this Trade never became the primary focus, insteadsecuring shipping and collecting tolls ensured a more militant orientation. 

During the Dragon Wars it became the location of a severe Battle between the rebelling Nords that inhabited the Fortress and the Atmoran Dragon Cult that saw the Island as essential beachhead on their way to suppress the Rebellion. Against the sheer force of Dragons and the Army of their cult the defenders had now chance. By the time the Rebellion won and banished Alduin to the future, the once proud Fortress was nothing but a windswept ruin.


## Abandoned and Lost in History
After the Dragon the once flourishing trade was severely down while both Civilisations rebuilt. During this time only a small Outpost was present in the ruins, to keep the Docks in working order and ensure the possiblity for basic ressupllies. 
Before the Atmoran side could fully rebuild they already were faced with increasingly cold weather. This forced the migration wave to Skyrim which temporarily increased the amount of visitors to the Island. Since the Island does not have any usable Farmland and easy building supplies and locations no one decided to stay. With the freezing of Atmora in the eternal winter, the reason for its existance vanished as well and so the Outpost was abandoned. 

Even though it was the site of serveral tragedies and heroics, none of them were as legendary as the night of tears, the banishing of alduin and many other events and so it slowly faded from memory. At this time and age its existance is just footnote in the speculative theories of some historians. At least it was until a certain individual became curious about a rumor...
