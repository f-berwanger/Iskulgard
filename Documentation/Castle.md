# Castle
The Castle ontop of the spire will be the central location and sanctuary for the player. It should feel like both it and the ship evolve together with the the player during the playthrough. 

The Goal was an interesting spin on the nordic style. The new version of the Great City of Winterhold mod was a heavy inspiration.
