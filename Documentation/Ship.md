# Ship
The ship has a central role in both the expedition to the Island as well as lore friendly fast travel to all provinces (once implemented by BS). The bretonic greyteship models from DevianKaled eg. That ship Guy will be used and slightly modified.

## Level Design
### Exterior
The original Model of the Greyteship was modified to include a steering wheel and an additional railing on the aft deck.

#### Upgrades:
* Ram and metal hull plating for icy sea (unlocks ghost sea maybe atmora if permission)
* Added Oars and locations for them (Unlocks some riverports in smaller estuaries)
* Upgrading Sails (retexture); (?? ingame effect)
* Upgraded Rowboat (Unlocks smaller locations at coast?)


### Interior
The interior is split in three seperate areas. The top will include the captains quarters. The middle section includes Crew Quarters, Cantine, Crafting Area. The lower bilge is for storage. 
Modifications will be made to connect steering wheel to rudder.

#### Top Level
##### Captains Quarters
This will be the highest room on the ship. It should feel both comfortable and convey a joy for adventuring. The Center, below the upper windows will be dominated by a table covered in maps.
* Storage, Bed
* Custom Fast travel system activator (get menu to switch province map - on map flags will be activatable for each destination)
* Ropes from Steering Wheel running through somewhere (Magically sealed agains water?)

##### Hallway
This connects all locations of the top level. Easiest accessable interior from deck.
* small bench/Chair to sit for 1-2 person
* ropes and other useful items stored alongside the walls.

##### Room
*??

#### Middle Level
##### Cantina
The largest Room apart from the storage hold. It should be the central hub for relaxing and getting warm for the crew.
*place for the crew to sit (6 seats around table)
*crafting cook,bake, maybe Alchemy

#####Crew Quarters
These are two seperate areas along the starboard side of the ship. Both are designed for two sailors.
* Two Beds/Hammocks
* Storage for personal belongings
* Small and tight space but not claustrophobic

##### Workshop
A small workshop is vital to keep a large ship in forking condition for a long journey. It should feel cramped and well used.
* Smithing, Workbench, SharpeningWheel
* Magic corner with Enchanting (renewing protective runes?)

##### Steering
A small room at the aft of the ship. It contains the rope and pulley system connecting Steering wheel to Rudder.
*??

##### First Mate/Mage Quarters
A room for a single persion. Still small but less cramped.
* Bed, Storage

##### Hallways
The Hallways should be mostly clear to allow for easy traversal in rough conditions. Maybe adding a few Handholds and railings could get that effect.

#### Lower Level
The lower level is a single large Room, filled with crates full of supplies. It should be sectiond for different goods, like food at one and, player loot at the oter etc.
