# Main Island Group

The location is an isolated island about halfway between Skyrim and Atmora in the middle of the Ghost Sea. The concept of the main island is an old volcanic crater, so the rock color will be dark and volcanic. The northern crater wall is higher and creates a small mountain range, sheltering the center from the harsh storms coming down from Atmora. The southern side was far lower and over time has been mostly eroded so only a ring of small islands remain above Sealevel. In the Center of the Crater a final small eruption has created a stone spire ontop of which the player home is located. Inside the Crater the land Sea will be relatively shallow allowing for interesting underwater level design, with shipwrecks, volcanic shafts or similar. 
The Island is supposed to feel like a sanctuary from the harsh climates of the ghost sea. For this reason there will also be a lot of wildlife, from Horker colonies, huge fish swarms to large nesting places of birds.
The Player can leave the Island with the Ship docked at the central spire or reach differnet locations on the Island by a smaller sailboat.

The reason a seperate worldspace was chosen is to make it as compatible as possible. Sadly ocean and clouds are one of the weekest aspects of the skyrim engine and having the player home look out over the sea would create very boring vistas. For this reason the Volcanic Crater Idea came up to create many interesting visuals.

The following sections will specify the seperate Areas in greater Detail:

## Northern Shield Mountains
The Northern Mountain range should tower over everything and feel oppressive, monumental and also protecting. Due to its shape and size it will have only a few interesting locations.

### Western Watch
The Western end of the Mountains should be lower than the rest and have a relatively flat center. This could be used for a small collapsed tower, shrine or some other small building. It should feel like very harsh and exposed, since it is not in the shadow of and Mountains.

### Dragon Cave
Lorewise the dragons flying between atmora and skyrim might also need a place to rest. For this reason and also for the incredible view a cave quite high up in the Mountain would be a good addition. Here there could be old dragon bones, and other visual storytelling. It should be reachable by a small mountain pass that snakes up the inner side of the mountain.

### Main Docks
The base of the mountain offers the longest uninterrupted "coastline" even though it will be mostly clifffaces. For this reason it would be logical to add the ruins of several docks here with a small warehouse. Here most ships on there travels would dock and trade goods, while the docks below the castle were reserved for military patrol vessels stationed there.

### Mines
To round up all neat player home functions adding minable ores in a seperate interior cell might be a good Idea. It would also provide a lot of options to play around with volcanic elements in a lower shaft. The Mine should not be to large since it would not make sense, since the extraced ore could hardly be shipped to atmora or skyrim in large quantities and the island does not offer large smelting and forging facilities.


## Southern Island Beld
The southern Islands consist of three seperate rings of Islands with the biggest closer to the crater center. They should feel dangerous and mysterious with a lot of shipwrecks, fog and riffs. During the first arrival on the Island it would be nice having a cinematic scene similar to ravenrock where the ship navigates between these Islands.
Due to the smaller size and dangerous shallows there should be no docks for larger ships here, just for smaller sail/rowboats.
Only one safe passage through the chain is planned, at least for larger vessels.

### Forward Defensive Bastion
On a good position in the inner or middle Island ring overlooking the safe passage a small defensive Fort could be an interesting location. A small tower and Barracks for about 4 people. Depending on the story these guards maybe could be resurrected draugr tasked with protecting the Island from unallowed visitors.

### Shipwrecks
Due to the dangerous passage through the southern Islands they could be littered with shipwrecks. This could act as interesting locations to explore/loot, artificial shelters for animals or just for interesting visuals.

## Central Spire
The central Spire will be the most intricate part of the worldspace. Most parts of the path leading up should look like they were carved directly out of the rock. The Castle and Bastion should also have darker stone to fit the darker volcanic rock of the spire.

### Docks
At sea level it includes docks for you ship, a small warehouse for quick loading/unloading of the ship. The docks are connected to the Castle by a winding path up the Spire and a cargo lift that can be restored. 

### Path and Bastion
During the Climb up the path the player will make a complete circle and so have a "forced" 360Â° view of the Crater. About halfway a crevisse blocks the way and a small forward bastion is situated here using it as a natural trench. It can be crossed using a drawbridge. The bastion only constists of a small tower, the wall with the drawbridge as well as a small guardhouse. It is big enough to offer accommedations for about 4 guards without beeing cramped full. What will be placed in the interior is still undecided. 
Further up the Path there will be a short tunnel, that has an additional defences in form of a portcullis with murderholes around it. This will be the final line of defence before reaching the castle walls.

### Castle
The top of the Spire is covered with parts of the castle. To approach the front gate after exiting the tunnel will require two additional small stairs. 

## Underwater 
Most of the concept is still undecided. At some locations like the Docks below the mountain there should be ruins visible below sea level. On the southern edge there should be a lot of treacherous rocks just below sea level with some shipwrecks on them. The Ocean Floor should rapidly fall of when you go beyond the crater edge, maybe adding an overpowerd monster to stop the player from swimming out further.
Inside the crater where the water is shallower it should be filled with fish and maybe vegetation.
