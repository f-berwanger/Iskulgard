# Chapter 1 Expedition
The First Chapter will focus on the Arc from the first mention up to finding and securing the Island. The first concept splits in up in several Acts.

## Act 1: First Mention
To start the Quest the player has to learn the legend from somewhere. Since its long forgotten and founded by Ysgramor an old memory place could mention the Island. Locations could be:
* The Wall of the 500 Companions in Windhelm
* The Palace of Windhelm
* The Entrance of the Tomb of Yngol
It could be implemented similar to the Wayshrines on the path up to High Hrothgar, where a message box appears.




## Act 2: Research
*I found an ancient plaque mentioning a fortified outpost in the Ghost Sea. I never heard anything about it before, seems it was mostly forgotten. Maybe I can find more Information about it in the Bards Collage or the Archive in the Collage of winterhold.*

This part of the quest should be a balance between provinding information while beeing very short and not tedious.

**Bards Collage:**
* Dialogue about differnent types of Ysgramos Legend
* ??
*It seems that there are different Versions of Ysgramors Legend and one mentions him finding Yngol on an Island where he was kidnapped by Sea Giants. After killing them all he supposedly founded an outpost there.*

**Collage of Winterhold**
* Dialogue with Librarian
* Find Book in Library
*There are several mentions of an Outpost securing the trade post between atmora and skyrim. The last mentions seem to be sometime around the dragon wars.*

## Act 3: Finding a Captain:
*It seems that the outpost was quite important and wealthy at some point. It might be good base of operation, but reaching it will be difficult and require a great ship and crew. Finding a Captain would be a good place to start.*

This Chapter should introduce the first major NPC in an interesting fashion. One question is if aquiring the ship and crew should be a short quest or the captain has a crew and ship.
* Find Captain in Tavern in Solitude

After this stage the ship and a few fast travel locations as well as several interior upgrades to the quarters and storage should be availible.
Possible upgrades would be:
* Interior quarter or storage upgrades
* exterior upgrades
* Crew Upgrades
* etc.

### Act 4: Finding Magical Support:
*Captain ??? was interested in the expedition was impossible without some way of calming the harsh climate in the ghost sea. I will have to find a way*

The Ghost sea should be protrayed as nearly unpassable, to enforce the vision the player has of how remote and defensible it is. 
* Learn Clear Sky shout
* Show to convince captain

### Act 5: Organising Expedition:
*With the proper thuum the voyage seems possible. There only remain a few necessary upgrades to make the **ShipName** resistant enough.*

The ship should have quite a lot of possible upgrades with some small game impact, so the ship evolves during the playthrough. This quest should require a few relatively cheap upgrades to "force" the player to engage with the system in a lorefirendly way. 
It should not take long or be very expensive to achieve this.
* Upgrade Hull with Metal reinforcement
* Add Icebreaker Ram
* Cold Weather Gear
* Supplies for long voyage

### Act 6: Setting Sails:
*With the final Hull reinforcement nailed down, the last crate of supplies secured and a final night of song and ale it is finally time to set the sails*

* meet captain at steering wheel
* Maybe cutscene? seperate interior cell of capains quarters in 5x size, and a map of the journey on the table. The Camera following a miniature Version of the Ship moving on the map

### Act 7: The Voyage
Here the Idea is to include an encounter. Either something like a dragon attack or hunting a few horkers on a icesheet. 
The Goal is to reinforce how harsh the weather is in the ghost sea.
Probably using similar effects like during the way up to the peak of the world where you get damage without using the clear sky shout.

### Act 8: The Arrival:
*After two weeks of sailing and searching today we finally saw an Island group that matches the description. We will try to find a way to the center and see what we can find.*

* Intro Cutscene, maybe camera high up then zooming down to ship and following the passage to the center from the deck similar to arrival in ravenrock
* Focus on shipwrecks and jagged cliffs on both sides during the passage.
* View opening up when reaching the center: nicer weather, several colonies of Horkers, Seabirds etc.
* Arrival and anchor at base of center cliff

### Act 9: 
*After finding a passage through the southern Island chain we reached the center. The main Fortress seems to have been located on the central spire, so we anchored on the ancient docks and start exploring* 

* Arrive at docks
* first walk up the path to the ruins on top, maybe some places using the evg traversal mod.
* finding the ruins and maybe dragon boss battle
* getting some valuable loot as reward

Secure the Island and start the second questline of restoring the Fortress and Island.
