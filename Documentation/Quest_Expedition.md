# ACT 1 Expedition
The First Act will focus on the Arc from hearing the legend up to finding and securing the Island. It will seperated in four steps:
1. Builidng interest for the Legend.
2. Organising an expedition
3. Travel to the island
4. Exploring and clearing the main island

These Steps will get there own sections in this document.

## Building the myth
The goal of the first part is to create an interest in the Island. THe legend could be overheard somewhere, read in a book or something similar. Some small quest should be included where you piece toghether parts of the legend to find some truth to it.

## Organising an expedition
Reaching the Island should include a bit of work. For this the player has to find a Ship and crew and prepare for the expedition. This could include upgrading the ship with a icebreaker ram, metal hull plating, winter clothing, food supplies etc. 
To get more information and build a longer realationship, a recruiting questline for the mage character might be included. For example finding him while he is studying an old nordic ruin.

## The journey
The Jouney should be a short quest. Here a seperate Worldspace for traveling could make the expedition feel like actual work. This could include encounters like wales, spirits, pirates etc. or a short quest to restock supplies.

## The Arrival
The Arrival should include a cinematic scene similar to the first arrival in ravenrock. Here the ship will steer through the southern islands. They are covered in mist where you first sea shipwrecks and small cliff islands. only after a few bends the fog will clear when you reach the center of the Crater. The first view should be something very memorable. 
After arriving there could be a few encounters with spirits, draugr or something similar and a climb to reach the top using the EVG Traversal Mod.

At this point the Expedition Questline will conclude and start the Rebuiding Questline.
