# Chapter 2: The Restoration
This Questline starts from clearing the Island up to the full restoration. It is split up in two steps, this first being the introduction of the second Major NPC as well as the rebuilding of the main Architecture. The second part is mix of a BYOH System and several small linar quests. 

## Act 1: Finding Help
*These Ruins seem like the optimal place to secure valuable and dangerous artifacts. Restoring them will an expensive and long project but worth it. I have to find someone with the knowladge to rebuild them*

Here you should here of a powerful mage studying nordic tomes. 
* Hear of the Mage
* Go to location
* Find Mage (some nice intro scene showing his power)
* meet outside (teleport with player and companions)
* Talk to Mage, make him interested in project

## Act 2: Laying first Stones
*After getting the support of **Mage Name** we can finally begin construction. I should meet him at the ruin and see his Ideas.*

* Reach Ruin
* Maybe walkthourgh to different Building foundations to tell what is planned on each?
* Get some Materials (Stone, Soulgems, etc.)

## Act 3: Foundations Layed
(Counter once week passed)
*It has been a week, I should check on **Mage Names** progress.*

* Intermittant rebuilding state (Maybe Zombie/Draugr Workers)
* Require some more materials

## Act 4: Standing Strong once Again
(Get letter?)
*The Exterior is finally finished. The Style is a remarkable mix of Atmoran and Nordic architecture with some elven touches. Time to take a tour*

two options:
* Activator and Messages:
    * Have a Tour with markers 
    * At each marker activator that displays short message and progresses to next marker
* Guided Tour by Mage with Voice Dialogue:
    * follow Mage arround
    * Each Main Area has short comments
    * Either actually walk or use loadscreen fades to switch between locations

At this stage the exterior and interior architecture is finished.
The rest focuses on furnishing and functionality of the interiors.
The next two quests are seperate and non linear:

## Exploring
*During the construction and time on the Island there are several locations that might be interesting to Explore*

* Main Dock Ruins (Several Destroyed Docks and Warehouses. Used to be main Dock for ship ressuplies and trade between Atmroa and Skyrim)
* Mountain Cave (Old Dragon landing site on trips between atmora and skyrim)
* Forward Defences (Old ruined Defence Tower maybe restorable in later version)
* etc. 

The Endgoal is to find the weapons unlocking the Sanctuary Vault.


## Restoration Quests
*To get reach the full potential **MageName** has several Ideas, but needs some special materials*

* Dwemer Materials (Tapping into Volcanic Heat)
* Water Supplies (water gathering on roof)
* Water Pressure (Dwemer pumps for supply on each level)
* 

Unlocks several BYOH Options each.

## BYOH System
Not really a Quest, but a form of progression System.
Each Area has its own activator and BYOH Options. 
The Main Functions, like crafting stations, beds etc. should be very cheaply craftable or already installed.
Other options should take a bit longer to unlock, so that the visuals slowly progress during the entire playthrough.


## Visual Changes
Some additinal Visual Changes from quest Progression could also be interesting. An example would be having a miniture light like the one in blackreach, after completing that part of the main quest. But due to compatability this is a non necessary feature that should have low priority.
