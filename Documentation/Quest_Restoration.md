# Rebuilding Questline
The Rebuilding Questline would be an opportunity to create the feeling of the Player Home evolving together with the player. THe Challenge will be creating a balance between needing time and ressources without feeling tedious and uninteresting.

The Rebuilding can be split in two Phases, first rebuildng the Architecture then restoring the interiors.

## Rebuilding the Architecture
This will be hard to implement since it will require different stages of rebuild from each exterior mesh. An Idea would be to have one rebuildng stage. So after finding the ruins the Player could supply the ressources and it will take a few days, then when the player returns everything will be in stage of construction. All walls about half height with the bricks and also some Pipes inlayed in the Wall shown. 
After supplying several more Materials and time the architecture will be restored when the player returns. 

## After completing the restoration of the Buildings the interiors and functions can be rebuilt
This could be split in two seperate mechanisms. 
A short Quest would unlock a specific feature. For example supplying dwemer materials so a few pipes could be layed down to tap into the heat of the volcanic activity below the surface. 
These quests could unlock several parts of a BYOH system. For example tapping the heat could allow for better temperatures in the greenhouse allowing more planters or hot water for the spa area.
