#### Personal Note
During my playthroughs of Skyrim I love having a homestead that starts out as nothing and slowly progresses as your character grows. 
As the dragonborn you gather a lot of powerful and dangerous artifacts, amass large amounts of wealth but also piss of a lot of powerful forces, from Dragons to Vampires or Dawnguard, Miraaks cult and a lot more. So it needs to be quite defensible for me to feel relaxed and safe there. 
Apart from that it needs to have a very unique Style where you find small hidden features or new views each time you visit. To get the Player more invested, well written NPCs are key, that fit into the story and lore to keep immersion. 

## Concepts
### Location
* Custom Worldspace – increase compatability
* Isolated island – ship fast travel system with compatibility with all BS Projects
* Ghost Sea – Myterious and hard to reach location. Blends in with vanilla Skyrim.
* Fortress – Defensible in case of assault, visually resisting harsh enviroment
* Ruins – Enalbes restoration Questline/Progression; EVG Traversal integration for first exploration
* Volcanic Crater – cloud and ocean in skyrim are visually uninteresting, this creates nice vistas
* Atmoran Outpost – tie it in with lore and give direction to Architecture Style
* Abandoned – create rediscovery, archeology questhooks. 

### Architecture
* Rebuilt atmoran Ruin – Strong visual connection to Windhelm/Nord Ruins/Great City of Winterhold Mod
* Robust Gothic Style – inspired by the GCW Mod, but far more robust looking. Sharp angles, Arches etc.
* Dark Volcanic Rock – contrast to frozen climate
* Douplicate worldspaces – actual windows to see outside
* Big windows – create contrast with warm light, nice view from interiors
* Building layout – visually interesting, create packed but elegent look
* Long winding climb – give surrounding 360° look of the Crater on climb and sense of scale

### Interiors
Seperated Areas in differnet Worldspaces/Interior Cells to have transparend windows
* Lower Bastion – Guard Quarters, 
* Entrance – Gate Defences, Main Hallway
* Foundry – Smithy, Enchanting, Ore/Hide Storage, Armory, Defences, mechanics workstation(dwemer)?
* Library – Book Storage, Mage Quarters, Observatory, Spell Crafting?
* Main Hall – Dining Hall, Living Room/Bar, Kitchen, NPC Room
* Master Bedroom – Player Bedroom, Study, Bathroom and „Batcave“

* Greenhouse – Planters (Food, Ingredients, Mushroom), Alchemy Lab, Relaxation Balcony
* Living Quarters – Follower Bedrooms, Training Room, Barracks, Cargo Lift
* Cellar – Food, Water to last siege, random hoarded loot
* Sanctuary – Secret, started locked, deadric artifacts, elder scrolls etc.

### Features

Several step quests:
1. Investigation (only player)
